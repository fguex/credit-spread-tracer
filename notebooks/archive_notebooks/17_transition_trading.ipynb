    "# Regime Transition Trading: 1-Day Directional Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Filter HMM regime transitions to identify profitable 1-day directional trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Hypothesis:** Not all regime transitions are created equal. Some transitions create exploitable 1-day directional moves after transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed Parameters:**\n",
    "- Trading horizon: Exactly 1 day (t → t+1)\n",
    "- Transaction costs: 5 bps round-trip\n",
    "- Directional trade only (long or short spread)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline:**\n",
    "1. Identify all regime transitions\n",
    "2. Label each transition: profitable (1) or unprofitable (0) after costs\n",
    "3. Engineer transition-specific features\n",
    "4. Train ML classifier to filter profitable transitions\n",
    "5. Add KNN similarity matching\n",
    "6. Combine scores into trading filter\n",
    "7. Backtest: trade only high-score transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criterion:** Sharpe > 0 after costs (baseline: trade all transitions)\n",
    "\n",
