    "# Predictive Modeling: Spread Dynamics and State Transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Develop predictive models for credit spread dynamics and HMM state transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Questions:**\n",
    "1. Can we predict spread direction (widen/tighten) at multiple horizons?\n",
    "2. Can we predict spread magnitude changes?\n",
    "3. Can we predict state transitions before they occur?\n",
    "4. Do regime-conditional features improve prediction accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation:** Walk-forward out-of-sample testing on 2021-2024 data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reality Check:** Predictive accuracy must be economically meaningful, not just statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
