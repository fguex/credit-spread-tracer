    "# Walk-Forward Backtesting: OU Process vs Classic Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build a production-grade walk-forward backtesting framework for credit spread mean reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Universe:** LQD (IG Corporate Bonds) vs IEF (7-10Y Treasuries)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Signals:**\n",
    "1. **OU Process:** Model credit spreads as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, use OU-adjusted z-scores\n",
    "2. **Classic Z-Score:** Simple rolling mean ± std deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regime Filter:** 2-state HMM (Low Stress vs High Stress) with weekly recalibration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Position Sizing:** Duration-neutral (hedge interest rate risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution:** Daily, with realistic transaction costs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principle:** Zero lookahead bias - simulate day-by-day as if living in the past.\n",
