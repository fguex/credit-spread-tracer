    "# Stress Period Trading with Risk-Adjusted Position Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Changes:**\n",
    "1. **Allow trading during stress** (previously blocked entirely)\n",
    "2. **Risk-adjusted position sizing:\n",
    "   - Normal periods: 50% position size\n",
    "   - High stress (Regime 1): 25% position size (half risk)\n",
    "3. **Optional minimum holding period** to reduce overtrading\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** Trading during stress with smaller positions might capture opportunities while managing risk.\n",
